In the long run, the goal of rfm is to develop tools for customer segmentation and lifetime value analysis. Included in version 0.0.1 are tools for RFM (recency, frequency and monetary) analysis.

## Installation

You can install rfm from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rsquaredacademy/rfm")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rfm)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

## Consistent Prefix

rfm uses consistent prefix `rfm_` for easy tab completion.

## Usage

### Introduction

**RFM** (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a behavior based technique used to segment customers by examining their transaction history  such as

- how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
- how often they purchase (frequency)
- how much the customer spends (monetary)

It is based on the marketing axiom that **80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers**. RFM helps to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions by segmenting them into various categories.

### Data

To calculate the RFM score for each customer we need transaction data which should include the following:

- a unique customer id 
- date of transaction/order
- transaction/order amount

### RFM Table

Use `rfm_table()` to generate the RFM score.

```{r rfm_table}
analysis_date <- lubridate::as_date('2006-12-31', tz = 'UTC')
rfm_result <- rfm_table(rfm_data, customer_id, order_date, revenue, analysis_date)
rfm_result
```


## Heat Map

The heat map shows the average monetary value for different categories of recency and frequency scores. Higher scores of frequency and recency are characterized by higher average monetary value as indicated by the darker areas in the heatmap. 

```{r heatmap, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
rfm_heatmap(rfm_result)
```

### Bar Chart

Use `rfm_bar_chart()` to generate the distribution of monetary scores for the different combinations of frequency and recency scores.

```{r barchart, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
rfm_bar_chart(rfm_result)
```

### Histogram

Use `rfm_histograms()` to examine the relative distribution of

- monetary value (total revenue generated by each customer)
- recency days (days since the most recent visit for each customer)
- frequency (transaction count for each customer)


```{r rfmhist, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
rfm_histograms(rfm_result)
```

### Customers by Orders

Visualize the distribution of customers across orders.

```{r rfmorders, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
rfm_order_dist(rfm_result)
```

### Scatter Plots

The best customers are those who:

- bought most recently
- most often 
- and spend the most

Now let us examine the relationship between the above.

#### Recency vs Monetary Value  

```{r mr, fig.align='center', fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
rfm_rm_plot(rfm_result)
```

#### Frequency vs Monetary Value

```{r fm, fig.align='center', fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
rfm_fm_plot(rfm_result)
```

#### Recency vs Frequency 

```{r fr, fig.align='center', fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
rfm_rf_plot(rfm_result)
```
